## 1. Purpose

This document aims to outline the best practices of holding and taking part in a daily stand up. It will describe the roles of those involved as well the process of having a stand up meeting.

## 2. What is a stand up meeting?

LiveLink's Tech Support version of a stand up is a protected time, in the morning of every day, where we stand by the kanban board to co-ordinate and share together as a team.

The stand up will last for 15 minutes and during that time we will stay focussed and give our attention to the person speaking.

Each day the stand up will be led by a different team member.



## 3. The Three Questions

During the stand up each attendee will answer these three questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What is impeding me?

## 4. Guidelines

1. Stand up will last no longer than 15 minutes
2. All team members will attend
3. All team members will run through the 3 questions
4. Items that are considered erroneous will be taken offline
5. Blocked items will be noted and followed up
